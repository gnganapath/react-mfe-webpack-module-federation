Steps:
create Root and Remote app using npx create-react ( webpack module federation architecture)
step:1
======
npx create-react-app react-host
npx create-react-app reaCT-remote

validate both app is running in local with plain react app component



step:2
======
we have 2 apps
react-host - parent app
reaCT-remote - child app
Dependencies for webpack config
Within each host/ and remote/ run:

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli html-webpack-plugin webpack-dev-server babel-loader

create a new webpack.config.js file at the root of host/

we need a new start script ->  
"scripts":{
    "start": "webpack serve"
  }

  at index.js

  change index.js into bootstrap.js

  importing another file bootstrap.js that renders the React app

  Spte:3
Add Module Federation
  webpack.config.js


  Spte:4 
  Configure remot app
  create -> remote/webpack.config.js

  Combining these will allow our host to find the remote code at Remote@http://localhost:4000/moduleEntry.js

  index.js to bootstrap.js
